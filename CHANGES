    Ready for 0.98

    Replace eval() with do() in the docs. Note that lexical declarations
    are preserved by compile(), which is used by do(), so declared
    variables need not be redeclared all the time.

  2008-11-03 20:02:16 (r16) by rcaputo; t/04_eval.t M

    Fix tests to use do() rather than eval().

  2008-11-03 19:57:55 (r15) by rcaputo; lib/Lexical/Persistence.pm M

    Another attempt at eval(), this time called do().

  t/04_eval.t A; MANIFEST M; lib/Lexical/Persistence.pm M
